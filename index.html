		<h1>Intro</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Eleanor. /wave</p>
		<p>I am a computer science educator with a passion for learning. I stumbled across <em>The Odin Project</em> a little while ago and was intrigued with the project's mission and its' approach to full-stack development pedagogy. However, as someone who teaches at the secondary level, I have a bone to pick and a passion for digital literacy. I believe that the <em>digital divide</em> is what keeps a lot of young, potential developers from having access to the tools they need to get to an intermediate level of coding.</p>
		<p>So I've taken on the challenge of completing TOP's curriculum and adapting its' lessons and exercises. My background in tech is your average STEM-adjacent person with an internet connection and a Windows OS.</p>
		<p>In conclusion: This project documents the assignments that I have completed according to the specifications of TOP's curriculum. But I will <em>not</em> be using TOP's suggested dev environment as I will also be approaching these lessons with the purpose of seeing the projects from the eyes of my students.</p>
