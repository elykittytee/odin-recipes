		<h1>Intro</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Eleanor. /wave</p>
		<p>I am a computer science educator with a passion for learning. I stumbled across <em>The Odin Project</em> a little while ago and was intrigued with the project's mission and its' approach to full-stack development pedagogy. However, as someone who teaches at the secondary level, I have a bone to pick and a passion for digital literacy. I believe that the <em>digital divide</em> is what keeps a lot of young, potential developers from having access to the tools they need to get to an intermediate level of coding.</p>
		<p>So I've taken on the challenge of completing TOP's curriculum and adapting its' lessons and exercises. My background in tech is your average STEM-adjacent person with an internet connection and a Windows OS.</p>
		<p>In conclusion: This project documents the assignments that I have completed according to the specifications of TOP's curriculum. But I will <em>not</em> be using TOP's suggested dev environment as I will also be approaching these lessons with the purpose of seeing the projects from the eyes of my students.</p>

					<p>If you would like to see my completion notes on how I approach adapting each lesson/section of the curriculum, you can see that on this page here. Please keep in mind that every Computer Science classroom environment is unique. These are my own personal opinions and ways that I will be using to adapt the curriculum for my students.</p>
