		<p>All my opinions are my own. Don't come for me :<</p>
			
		<h2>Foundations</h2>
		
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>how the course works</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Oooooo. I like this. It targets a very specific individual something new.</li>
					<li>Okay. I won't skip anthing. It'll be fine.</li>
					<li>Narrator: it was not fine</li>
				</ul>
			<li>intro to web dev</li>
				<ul>
					<li>cool cool. we got the overview. A little wordy for those who don't like to read or work through a process. But all good stuff. All good things.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>motivation and mindset</li>
				<ul>
					<li>this section sounds like how I teach. but it also specifically targets what may hold you back. eeeenteresting.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>asking for help</li>
				<ul>
					<li>aaaaand all of gen z gets attacked</li>
				</ul>
			<li>join the odin community</li>
				<ul>
					<li>READ ALL OF THIS. No really, this is where the 'asking for help' section is tailored to 'how to ask for help specifically for TOP'.</li>
					<li>but is also a very good resource on how tech questions SHOULD be asked. don't come to me for answers if you don't even know how to ask.</li>
					<li>ie. "it's not working, I need help" is a very broad statement and it's not my job to figure out what you need.</li>
					<li>unless you're a teacher. <em>*cries in teacher*</em></li>
				</ul>
			<li>how does the web work</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you took AP CS Principles course and did the exam, you know this stuff already.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>installation overview</li>
				<ul>
					<li>this is the part where I am confused, because I learned how to code with a windows OS because I'm old and capable.</li>
					<li>I've built websites from scratch before and uploaded my stuff to the host and everything. tell me why....?</li>
					<li>I then join the discord server</li>
				</ul>
