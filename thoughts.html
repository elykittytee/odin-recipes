		<h3 id="section1">Introduction</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>how the course works</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Oooooo. I like this. It targets a very specific individual something new.</li>
					<li>Okay. I won't skip anthing. It'll be fine.</li>
					<li>Narrator: it was not fine</li>
				</ul>
			<li>intro to web dev</li>
				<ul>
					<li>cool cool. we got the overview. A little wordy for those who don't like to read or work through a process. But all good stuff. All good things.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>motivation and mindset</li>
				<ul>
					<li>this section sounds like how I teach. but it also specifically targets what may hold you back. eeeenteresting.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>asking for help</li>
				<ul>
					<li>aaaaand all of gen z gets attacked</li>
				</ul>
			<li>join the odin community</li>
				<ul>
					<li>READ ALL OF THIS. No really, this is where the 'asking for help' section is tailored to 'how to ask for help specifically for TOP'.</li>
					<li>but is also a very good resource on how tech questions SHOULD be asked. don't come to me for answers if you don't even know how to ask.</li>
					<li>ie. "it's not working, I need help" is a very broad statement and it's not my job to figure out what you need.</li>
					<li>unless you're a teacher. <em>*cries in teacher*</em></li>
				</ul>
			<li>how does the web work</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you took AP CS Principles course and did the exam, you know this stuff already.</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>
		
		<h3 id="section2">Installation</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>installation overview & prerequisites</li>
				<ul>
					<li>this is the part where I am confused, because I learned how to code with a windows OS because I'm old and capable.</li>
					<li>I've built websites from scratch before and uploaded my stuff to the host and everything. tell me why....?</li>
					<li>I then join the discord server</li>
				</ul>

				<p>HOKAY. LEMME GET ON MY SOAPBOX.</p>
				<p>so you mean to tell me that <em>because you are so lazy to not even teach a basic, non-STEM human being how to simulate a coding environment in TODAY'S CURRENT AGE of cloud-based work environments for a completely different operating system</em>, your super aggressive anti-Windows, passive aggressive super-Mac elitist attitude is the best way to get your point across that a Unix-based environment is the master-race of dev? Your single section, 5 page passive aggressive diatribe could've been solved with "Make a GitHub account and follow these steps for the easiest web dev environment. Oh, and here's a page of methods that don't work". Yet you absolutely needed 5 pages to do this.</p>
				<p>Every single other baby coder website that doesn't go into the detail that you intended to go into because its' purpose is just to get your feet wet did this better than you: met your learners where they are at.</p>				
				<p>I was super turned off by this attitude of computer OS elitism beause that's not how the world works and that's not how the world learns. As someone who knows how to do the things outlined in the guide, I was offended at the effort taken to systematically (via the guide and the Discord rules) tear down someone's current technology situation because of something as simple as "it's not optimized for the way we are going to teach". But also, just read the Discord rules. Unnecessarily aggro. fr.</p>
				<p>AND JUST FOR THAT</p>
				<p>I'm going to purposely finish this curriculum with a Windows OS, not using a Unix-based system, not using the command line environment. Because that's not how my students learn and that's not the best way to set them up for success when not everyone's technology situation is capable or available.</p>
				<p>I shamelessly admit I spent about 24 hours stewing over this very concept. And I commit myself to doing better.</p>

			<li>text editors</li>
				<ul>
					<li>text editors always make your text look pretty.</li>
					<li> 9000/10 get one. so purrty.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>command line basics</li>
				<ul>
					<li>ugh. skip this. we're not using unix. just plain old Windows. /eyeroll</li>
					<li>see my rant above</li>
				</ul>
			<li>setting up git</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm just.....going to use github</li>
					<li>I want to be as close to my student's situations as possible. If I'm a prepubescent teen who had no prior CS and my parents are totally clueless, this is an intimidating endeavor.</li>
					<li><strong>and sadly</strong>, this is the situation for a lot of people who want to do this, are STEM-adjacent, and are willing but don't have the prior experience.</li>					
				</ul>
			<li>intro to git</li>
				<ul>
					<li>so I made a new account on github. It's no different from your average cloud-based workspace.</li>
					<li>but this one is for code. and I can publish my html docs straight to the web.</li>
					<li>Narrator: the teacher has found a workaround. repl.it is also another alternative source to adapt.</li>

			<li>git basics</li>
				<ul>
					<li>DON'T SKIP.</li>
					<li>adapt the things for github. but you don't need to use the command line stuff.</li>
					<li>find the buttons that commit changes and things. You will need to be patient though, it takes some time for the things to save, upload, and publish.</li>
