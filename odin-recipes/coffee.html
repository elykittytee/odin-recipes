		<h2>Description, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">Wikipedia</a></h2>
		<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.</p>
		<p>This recipe will be for making fresh ground coffee with a drip maker. Everyone's personal coffee preferences are unique. Not every coffee cup is made the same.</p>
