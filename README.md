# Intro
Hi, I'm Eleanor. /wave

I stumbled across The Odin Project a little while ago and was intrigued with the project's mission and its' curriculum content for full-stack development. I am always open to new approaches in Computer Science pedagogy.

As a computer science educator, I've taken on the challenge of completing TOP's curriculum and adapting its' lessons and exercises for a more inclusive classroom and equitable approach to completing its projects.  As someone who teaches at the secondary level, I have a passion for digital literacy. I believe that the digital divide is what keeps a lot of talented, potential developers from having access to the tools they need to achieve an intermediate level of coding.


> In conclusion: This project documents the assignments that I have completed according to the assignments of TOP's curriculum. But I will not be using TOP's suggested dev environment. I will be approaching these lessons with the purpose of seeing the projects from the eyes of my students. Or in other words, as an average STEM-adjacent person with an internet connection and a Windows OS.
