# The Odin Project, Attempt #1

## Project Overview

I stumbled across The Odin Project a little while ago and was intrigued with the project's mission and its' curriculum content for full-stack development. I am always open to new approaches in Computer Science pedagogy.

As a computer science educator, I've taken on the challenge of completing TOP's curriculum and adapting its' lessons and exercises for a more inclusive classroom and equitable approach to completing its projects.  As someone who teaches at the secondary level, I have a passion for digital literacy. I believe that the digital divide is what keeps a lot of talented, potential developers from having access to the tools they need to achieve an intermediate level of coding.

## Equity Concerns
* How accessible is The Odin Project to new learners?
  * Things that will affect this: Professional bias used in the language of the lessons, what the instructor/writers assume the user has access to, any other hurdles identified by the instructor/writers
 * How much time is expected for learners to complete the assignments?
  * This is largely dependent on the age + stage of life the learner is in. I'll be looking for those who place The Odin Project as one of the courses leading to their success in the industry
 * How culturally responsive is The Odin Project?
  * Coupled with the things above, I'll be comparing the experience of learning using the methods outlined in the curriculum with the experience of teaching those same concepts to my students.

## Summary
### (in progress)
> This repository documents the assignments that I have completed according to the assignments of TOP's curriculum. But I will not be using TOP's suggested dev environment. I will be approaching these lessons with the purpose of seeing the projects from the eyes of my students. Or in other words, as an average STEM-adjacent person with an internet connection and a Windows OS.
