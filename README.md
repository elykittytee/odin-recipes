# Intro
Hi, I'm Eleanor. /wave

I am a computer science educator with a passion for learning. I stumbled across _The Odin Project_ a little while ago and was intrigued with the project's mission and its' approach to full-stack development pedagogy. However, as someone who teaches at the secondary level, I have a bone to pick and a passion for digital literacy. I believe that the digital divide is what keeps a lot of young, potential developers from having access to the tools they need to get to an intermediate level of coding.

So I've taken on the challenge of completing TOP's curriculum and adapting its' lessons and exercises. My background in tech is your average STEM-adjacent person with an internet connection and a Windows OS.

> In conclusion: This project documents the assignments that I have completed according to the specifications of TOP's curriculum. But I will not be using TOP's suggested dev environment as I will also be approaching these lessons with the purpose of seeing the projects from the eyes of my students.
